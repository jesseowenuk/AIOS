Using ChatGPT to teach me about operating systems - take everything you see here with a pinch of salt, I'm expecting most of it not to work!

Everything here will be highly commented and commits will sometimes include errors (though I'll try to note when they do)

## To Assemble & Run
NOTE: I'm on a mac running Nasm and Qemu, you will need this installed to run.

To assemble in the root directory run

```
make
```

To run in the root directory run
```
make run
```

To clean up in the root directory run
```
make clean
```

## Experiements
The experiements folder contains experiments which aren't part of the final product but are useful learning experiments and examples.

They are assembled and run in the same way as the main project, cd into the experiements directory and then call nasm and then Qemu on them.
